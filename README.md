# superconductive

Basic program to print the solar longitude at given a UTC time, retrieved from an API endpoint.

Built to run in an IDE like PyCharm. You will need to have the relevant libraries installed: Flask and astropy

After downloading, start up the flask endpoint from which we will retrieve our time data:
flask run

The time data that is returned can be changed in the app.py class.

Then simply run the main class to retrieve the solar coordinates.
